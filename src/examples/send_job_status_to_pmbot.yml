  Use this webhook to send notifications to our backend. See our docs here: https://docs.pmbot.io/ci-providers/circle-ci.

  This orb needs to be used on every job that your .circle/config.yml file contains.

  The orb makes a simple HTTP request to Pmbot server to notify when a job ends. Pmbot can then check the status of your pipeline and determine whether the update of your dependency failed. The orb uses various environment variables named PMBOT_... that are configured automatically by Pmbot when you setup a repository. These variables are used by our orb to authenticate the webhook call.

  Additionally, it uses both environment variables PMBOT_UPDATE_ID and PMBOT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, configured as pipeline parameters and sent by Pmbot when triggering pipelines when your automated updates are scheduled.

usage:
  version: 2.1

  # use pmbot orb
  orbs:

  # parameters sent when we trigger an update
  parameters:
    PMBOT:
      type: boolean
      default: false
    PMBOT_UPDATE_ID:
      type: string
      default: ''

  jobs:
    # add this job
    update:
      docker:
        - image: pmbot/bot

    update:
      # don't exec this workflow during normal pipelines
      when: << pipeline.parameters.PMBOT >>
